Each boat can carry at most 2 people. The best intuition here is to pair the lightest person with the heaviest one. The first thing we need to do is repeatedly identify the lightest and heaviest elements. Sorting the array provides an effective solution to this problem.

Once sorted, we check the heaviest person (the last element of the array) along with the lightest person (the first element). If their combined weight does not exceed the limit, we can pair them together; otherwise, we send the heaviest person in a boat alone. If he cannot fit with the lightest person, he is unlikely to fit with anyone else.
