It is easy to solve this problem using brute force clearly.

However more efficient solution appears when taking a different
approach:

We are aiming to maximize the width & height of our container . . so 

why don't we start by trying the edges of our input (first and last 

elements) as it provides maximum width for a start, now we're seeking

to iterate over all array elements but how do we start?!

since moving left to right or right to left reduces width we try to focuse

on keeping the height maximized by comparing the tow indexes we 

have and moving the smaller one only and stop when the tow indexes 

meet each other this way by on iteration over the array we cover all 

important pairs
