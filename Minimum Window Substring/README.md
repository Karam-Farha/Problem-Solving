# Problem Description
Given tow strings S and T find minimum substring in S which contain all the characters in T

## Constraint Questions
- It is guaranteed that there will be only one valid window every time.
- It is guaranteed that strings S and T contain only alphabetic characters.
- The order of characters in T does not need to match the order in the substring of S.
- The frequency of characters in the substring must exactly match the frequency in T. For example, if T has only one 'a', the substring must also have exactly one 'a'.
- If no such substring is found, return an empty string "".

## examples
### input: 	S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
### ans:	BANC
